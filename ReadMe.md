## Architecture and Design
I used (MVVM), repository pattern, and clean architecture.
I used all 3 together to achieve a more structured code and less tight coupling between components.
At a high level, I have 3 layers in the project which I have implemented as packages, all in one module.
These layers include:
1. `Data Layer:` 
2. `Domain layer:`
3. `Presentation layer:`
